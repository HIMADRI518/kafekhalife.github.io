#### NOTE:  
_For those that joined the live session or are watching the recording, there was a typo that caused the Azure WebApp Deployment to fail. In the azure_web_deploy.yml workflow, I fixed the issue by updating the environment variable reference to be "$${{ env.IMG_URL }}. Check out the latest commit to see the fix!_
