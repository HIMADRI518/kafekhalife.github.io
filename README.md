# Welcome to Kafe Khalife :coffee:
### The perfect place to pick up some coffee, containers, and kubernetes! 

Thank you all who attended our GitHub Talk on Containerized Deployments for enterprises with GitHub Actions & Packages! 

Here are links to find some of the resources mentioned during the session:
- [Actions developed (and standardiazed) by Azure](https://github.com/Azure/actions)
- [GitHub Roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap/projects/1)
- [Containerized Deployment slide deck]()


_NOTE
For those that joined the live session or are watching the recording, there was a typo that caused the Azure WebApp Deployment to fail. In the azure_web_deploy.yml workflow, I fixed the issue by updating the environment variable reference to be "$${{ env.IMG_URL }}. Check out the latest commit to see the fix!_
